# Prediction of Student Performance
The student performance is predicted with a linear regression.  
The dataset used is from the "UCI Machine Learning Repository" and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00320/).  
This project is based on a tutorial by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg).
